    "# Part 6: Wiggle, Wiggle\n",
    "OK, so our network is not getting to a low loss, or at least not very quickly, as we add new colors. It's kind of worrisome really... how will it perform with 48 or 96 or the full 120 crayon box of colors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try something before we add new colors. There's a trick in neural network training that lets you take your existing data and create a lot more of it by doing a bit of coding work and letting the computer create more \"free\" data for you. Neural networks like lots of examples - you'll spend more time training the network, but much of the time you can get a better training result afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our data, our color names and RGB values, we can \"wiggle\" the R, G, and B numbers a bit and still have the same color. Think about it: If gray is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), your eye can't see much if any difference vs. (0.49, 0.49, 0.49) or (0.51, 0.51, 0.51) or (0.48, 0.48, 0.48). We could easily wiggle each of our RGB triples and call it the same color. Also note we can wiggle each R or G or B independently, so we could get (0.48, 0.50, 0.51) and still call it gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happens. First, we copy our previous network code, with a few tweaks. Challenge: see if you can spot what I changed vs. the last lesson; there are 2 changes to find."
